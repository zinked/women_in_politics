# Women in Politics

Welcome 

This repository contains information and preliminary results on our research project on the participation and representation of women in politics in Tanzania.

We are conducting the first round of an online survey in October 2020. We plan to conduct the second round in November 2020. Once we have collected all data, we will upload preliminary results in this website.

If you have any questions or comments about the survey or the research project, please send us an e-mail to: [survey.women.politics@gmail.com](mailto:survey.women.politics@gmail.com)
